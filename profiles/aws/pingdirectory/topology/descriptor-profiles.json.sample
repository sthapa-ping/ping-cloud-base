# This file shows samples of a PingDirectory topology descriptor file that's required in multi-region deployments.
# It should be omitted in single-region deployments.

# NOTE:
# - If provided externally through the 'topology-descriptor' ConfigMap (see k8s-configs/base/ping-cloud/descriptor.json),
#   then its name must be descriptor.json.
# - If provided through server profiles (i.e. in this directory), then its name must be descriptor-profiles.json.
# - If both are provided, then the descriptor file provided through the ConfigMap will be used.

# The general format should be:

{
	"<region>": {
		"hostname": "<external-dns-name>",
		"replicas": <number-of-replicas-in-region>
	},
	"<region>": {
		"hostname": "<external-dns-name>",
		"replicas": <number-of-replicas-in-region>
	},
    ...
}

# region-name - the region where the local Kubernetes cluster is located
# external-dns-name - the external DNS hostname of the Kubernetes headless service that's in front of the servers in that region
# replicas - the number of servers in the replication topology in that region

For example:

{
	"us-west-2": {
		"hostname": "pingdirectory-cluster.foo1.bar1",
		"replicas": 6
	},
	"eu-west-1": {
		"hostname": "pingdirectory-cluster.foo2.bar2",
		"replicas": 3
	}
}

# The above descriptor implies that PingDirectory server hostnames will be:
#   - pingdirectory-0.pingdirectory-cluster.foo1.bar1, pingdirectory-1.pingdirectory-cluster.foo1.bar1, etc. (6 total)
#     in region us-west-2
#   - pingdirectory-0.pingdirectory-cluster.foo2.bar2, pingdirectory-1.pingdirectory-cluster.foo2.bar2, etc. (3 total)
#     in region eu-west-1

# Here's a valid example of a 'preview' Ping Cloud customer 'coral' for its 'stage' CDE in 2 regions -
# 'us-east-2' and 'eu-central-1':

{
	"us-east-2": {
		"hostname": "pingdirectory-cluster.stage-coral.us1.ping-preview.cloud",
		"replicas": 2
	},
	"eu-central-1": {
		"hostname": "pingdirectory-cluster.stage-coral.eu1.ping-preview.cloud",
		"replicas": 2
	}
}
